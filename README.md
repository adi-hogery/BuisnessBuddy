## Now for the patient readers:
This Project was made for a company that needed An information system.
this system created to collect, process, store, and disseminate information that gathers data on orders, employees, customers, supplies, and suppliers. This system allows you to search for and retrieve information from a database that I have created, which serves as a repository for all of this data.
Let's take a closer look at each of the components in your system:

Orders: This component tracks all of the orders that your business receives from customers. It includes information such as the customer name, the order date, the products or services ordered, and the order status (e.g. pending, fulfilled, cancelled).

Employees: This component tracks information about your employees, including their names, contact information, job titles, and performance metrics (e.g. sales numbers, customer satisfaction ratings).

Customers: This component tracks information about your customers, including their names, contact information, purchase history, and any preferences or special requests they may have.

Supplies: This component tracks information about the supplies that your business uses to produce its products or services. This could include raw materials, equipment, or any other resources necessary to carry out your operations.

Suppliers: This component tracks information about the suppliers that you work with to obtain the supplies you need. This could include contact information, pricing and payment terms, and any other relevant details.

All of this information is stored in a database that you have created. This database is a structured collection of data that allows you to easily store, organize, and retrieve information. By using a database, you can search for specific pieces of information quickly and efficiently, which can help you make more informed business decisions.

In summary, your information system is a powerful tool that allows you to gather, store, and retrieve data on orders, employees, customers, supplies, and suppliers. By using this system, you can make better-informed decisions about your business operations, which can help you improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase customer satisfaction.
